# React Frontend Project

This task covers React basics as well as your testing skills with limited time.


## General

* Focus on a working solution rather than the most beautiful or complex
* All tasks features will start from the `develop` branch and you have to create a branch for your tasks, e.g., `task/01-listuser`
* When you are done with a task, please create a merge/pull request to branch `develop`.
* You are allowed to merge between task/feature branches. 
* When you finished a task please create a work in progress pull request back to `develop` and assign it to @expertsieve.
* If you can not finish a task or have an issue during implementation try to explain it in the pull request description and/or `README` file
* Leave some documentation about how to built your solution, built.sh and start.sh scripts are welcome.
* If you have any questions during your test task, please visit https://expertsieve.freshdesk.com or write an email to support@fyltura.de

## Task 1

Create a React[^1] application that lists all users and their addresses provided by the users API of JSONPlaceholder[^2].

## Task 2

Add at least one unit test for each of the components you created using Jest[^3]. More is better.

## Task 3

Add the possibility to view the albums and the photos of a selected user.


## Expectations


- Document your coding process with Git[^5] and publish your result to the repository you got along with 
this tasks. We will then clone your code and run it locally on our machines.
- The result in the repository should be a git history of your development process (a single commit with
the complete application is not acceptable. 
- We want to see multiple commits showing your progress), a README document on how to install and start your application, and a package.json with scripts to build and serve your application.
- Styling of your html is not necessary. Simple is better than complicated. 
- Consider your application a proof-of-concept, quicker development using tools to achieve the result is better than hand crafting every line but taking 5x as long. 
- You can use whatever resources/libraries/open-source in addition (but not as a replacement) of the libraries previously mentioned. 
- If you use a cli that writes 98% of your code, fine! 
- If you want to use different testing libraries, feel free to do so, but please provide some arguments.
- If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact us.
